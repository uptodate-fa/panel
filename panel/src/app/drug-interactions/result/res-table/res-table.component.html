                      with each other in a clinically significant manner. The
                      risks associated with concomitant use of these agents
                      usually outweigh the benefits. Concurrent use of these

                      Data demonstrate that the two medications may interact
                      with each other in a clinically significant manner. A
                      patient-specific assessment must be conducted to determine
                      whether the benefits of concomitant therapy outweigh the
                      risks. Specific actions must be taken in order to realize
                      the benefits and/or minimize the risks resulting from
                      concomitant use of the agents. These actions may include
                      aggressive monitoring, empiric dosage changes, or choosing
                      alternative agents.

                      <strong>Monitor Therapy</strong>
                      Data demonstrate that the specified agents may interact
                      with each other in a clinically significant manner. The
                      benefits of concomitant use of these two medications often
                      outweigh the risks. An appropriate monitoring plan should
                      be implemented to identify potential negative effects.
                      Dosage adjustments of one or both agents may be needed in
                      some patients.
