                      Data demonstrate that the specified agents may interact
                      with each other in a clinically significant manner. The
                      risks associated with concomitant use of these agents
                      usually outweigh the benefits. Concurrent use of these
                      agents should generally be avoided.</span

                      Data demonstrate that the two medications may interact
                      with each other in a clinically significant manner. A
                      patient-specific assessment must be conducted to determine
                      whether the benefits of concomitant therapy outweigh the
                      risks. Specific actions must be taken in order to realize
                      the benefits and/or minimize the risks resulting from
                      concomitant use of the agents. These actions may include
                      aggressive monitoring, empiric dosage changes, or choosing
                      alternative agents.
